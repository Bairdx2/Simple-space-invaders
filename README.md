# Simple-space-invaders

A simple implementation of the Space Invaders game. The main character is a rectangle that can
move left and right. The aliens move up and down for now but will later be able to move left, 
down, right, down like the original. The player is able to shoot a small rocket towards the group 
of aliens.
